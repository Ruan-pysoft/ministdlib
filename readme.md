# Ruan's Mini Stdlib

A toy stdlib for c89 made for fun and learning
(and procrastinating studying math...)

This is NOT COMPLETE,
and the api is NOT STABLE,
DO NOT USE except for recreational code
that may BREAK AT ANY MOMENT.

## License

(Also, work out again how dual licensing works,
I know some countries don't play well
with dual licensing or public domain licenses)

I want to add the option for some public domain-equivalent license,
such as cc0 or bsd 0-clause.

But for now only MIT license, see the file `license.mit`
