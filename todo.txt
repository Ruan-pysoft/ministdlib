add proper const qualifiers to pointers where applicable

More complete memory.h
	memcpy, memmove, etc
	make memzero more efficient

Add dedicated close function to FILE
	should always be called to free resources when done with file

Actually make memory allocation work
	Currently calling syscall #0, not actually sbrk...

Move over from sbrk to mmap
	Maybe also use sbrk for small values?

implement multithreading

rethink strings.h

implement buffered io

fix all the warnings the compiler's giving me
	especially those relating to incorrect c89

...

printf-style suite

scanf-style suite

high-level input (have puts, putc, etc, but no getc, gets, getline, etc)

ANSI escape sequence helpers

proper error handling (enum?)
	+ errstr

move argv & envp to gobal (read-only) structure
