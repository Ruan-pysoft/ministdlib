refactor code style
	k&r function decl to ISO c decl
	ret name(args...) -> ret \n name(args...)

change ref and arr to ref and own
	-> rather than distinguishing pointers & arrays,
	   distinguished owned & borrowed values

Actually make memory allocation work
	Currently calling syscall #0, not actually sbrk...

Move over from sbrk to mmap
	Maybe also use sbrk for small values?

implement multithreading

rethink strings.h

implement buffered io

fix all the warnings the compiler's giving me
	especially those relating to incorrect c89

...

printf-style suite

scanf-style suite

high-level input (have puts, putc, etc, but no getc, gets, getline, etc)

ANSI escape sequence helpers

proper error handling (enum?)
	+ errstr

move argv & envp to gobal (read-only) structure
