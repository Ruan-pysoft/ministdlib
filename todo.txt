memory efficiency: improve efficiency of memmove and memzero

! implement multithreading
	1. implement polling for FILE's with fd's
	2. implement `clone`
	3. implement atomics, locks, and memory barriers
	4. implement a threadpool interface
	5. implement proper(!) testing for multithreading (especially atomics and locks)
	6. (later?) implement message-passing

rethink strings.h

Upgrade the test suite

printf with floats
expand printf suite to have field width specifiers, etc
	probably with some sort of fmt struct?

? Support for format strings
	Unsure how to have compile-time type safety...

scanf with floats
scanf with string type
expand scanf suite to restrict amount of characters it'll read from the input buffer

documentation

Some static checks (eg. enforcing own/ref semantics)

! Move todo's over to todo.sr.ht
